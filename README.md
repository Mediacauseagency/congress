Congress Project
This is an ongoing work in progress.
Currently it gets all Senators and Representatives and follows them on Twitter.
Run the get_congress.py first. Ensure that you have the tweepy wrapper.

Changelog:2014.3.1.2328
First commit. Source works. Still need to check all friends against the congressDB to ensure that information is updated and that only current Members are being followed.
